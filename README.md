# Gravityformer

Code for manuscript "A Gravity-informed Spatiotemporal Transformer for Human Activity Intensity Prediction".

# Introduction:
This is a Pytorch implementation of Gravityformer. Our code is based on ASTGCN (https://github.com/guoshnBJTU/ASTGCN-r-pytorch).

# Pre:
Step1: Clone the code of ASTGCN.

Step2: Put Gravityformer.py into model and SF_astgcn.conf into configurations.


# Train and Test:
Please refer to ASTGCN's Run and Test (https://github.com/guoshnBJTU/ASTGCN-r-pytorch).

# Datasets:
Due to privacy issues associated with the datasets, please contact Prof. Di Zhu (dizhu@umn.edu) if you require access to the data.
